As a law firm we receive e-mails from a wide range of people – private individuals, organisations and companies. From time to time our people are concerned if e-mails are malicious, such as: 
an elaborate social engineering scheme,
phishing,
time wasting business enquiry
or just unusual, but valid business enquiries.
Your task is to come up with guidance on how to determine if an e-mail is malicious or not as well as an automated tool that implements some or part of the checks in the guidance and provide a short write-up / video on how the tool works.

We also appreciate that time you could spend on this may be limited, so please prioritise and in your write-up describe how you decided that these checks are the most important.

We expect that you will make use of GenAI / Vibe coding, but this should not be a substitute for your own thinking and analysis, and you should be able to discuss the task and outcomes during interviews.  Please describe how you used GenAI tools if you did.
